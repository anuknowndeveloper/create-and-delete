# create-and-delete
some short code thing for python 
oh yeah also put the full path if you're creating or deleting a file because if you put a path with no file specified on it then the program gonna get confusion
if no path is specified then it'll create/delete a file in the project directory
yeah that's it use it when you want and enjoy i guess

i might also update this so eyahhh
